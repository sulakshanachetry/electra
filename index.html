                <div class="item-content">
                    <p>The Department of Electrical Engineering of NIT, Silchar is one of the finest and well equipped Electrical departments of the north-east region. It boasts of having a highly qualified faculty with an unparalled level of expertise in their field. Under the able Headship of Dr. B. K. Roy and a strong faculty team, the Department offers an 8 Semester B.Tech. Programme in Electrical Engineering, a four Semester M.Tech. Programme in Power Energy Systems Engineering and also a well integrated Ph.D. programme. The department offers core courses in Power Systems, Control Systems, Electrical Machines, Instrumentation, Switchgear and Industrial Protection, Microprocessors and Microcontrollers etc. Apart from these, the final year students can choose from a wide array of electives in the form of Computer Aided Power Systems, Flexible AC Transmission etc. In coordination with the highly stimulating lectures and quality enhancing tutorials in these courses, various practical courses are also held in the state-of-the-art Lab facilities of the department like Machine Lab, Measurement Lab, Circuit Theory Lab and Microprocessor Lab, to name a few. The Department of Electrical Engineering is dynamic and vibrant in true sense. Various research and development activities taken up by the department put the students on busy schedules enabling them to blend to the modern industrial requirements. The course structure is constantly restructured to meet the ever changing requirements of the volatile industrial market, keeping the essence of the core Electrical Engineering intact. The pure expertise and dedication of the faculty members along with infrastructural facilities coupled with the perseverance of the students have catapulted the branch to the top league. Placement offers to the students have always shown an ever increasing trend and promise to be the best in future with the incoming boom of Power sector. The department also has its own society, the 'Electra' comprising of the faculty members and the 300 strong student members. It caters to all the academic and co-curricular persona of the branch. Cultural events for the members are never scarce along with quizzes, aptitude tests, presentations and industrial tours which are organised to bring the best out of a today's Electrical Engineer.</p>
